      <h2>About me.</h2>
      <p>
        "IÂ´m a Front-End Developer with a proven ability to collaborate
        effectively with senior developers while spending extra time to be
        mentored. Enjoy working closely with team members to ensure workloads
        are effectively redirected to bottlenecks and personally picking up the
        slack when necessary. With a passion for both personal growth and for
        software development, I attended a 1000+ hour coding bootcamp to learn
        new languages while sharpening existing skills. Ready to apply my
        passion for coding to a talented engineering team to develop quality
        solutions."
